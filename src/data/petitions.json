However, your team debates whether to allow open submissions from everyone or apply a strict quality filter before proposals go public.",
 "question": "How will you design the proposal submission process?",
 "learnMore": "The Latvian MyVoice platform became one of the most successful legislative crowdsourcing tools by ensuring citizen initiatives were specific, constitutional, and feasible. Initially publishing only 20% of submitted proposals, it gradually built public trust by enforcing transparent quality filters. This professional moderation helped increase uptake and legislative follow-up: 27 of 50 submitted initiatives were supported by parliament by 2019.",
